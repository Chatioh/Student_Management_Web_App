|-------------|-------|------------|
| 80-100      | A     | 4.0        |
| 70-79       | B     | 3.0        |
| 60-69       | C     | 2.0        |
| 50-59       | D     | 1.0        |
| 0-49        | F     | 0.0        |

**GPA Calculation Formula:**
```
GPA = Σ(Grade Points × Credit Hours) / Σ(Credit Hours)
```
